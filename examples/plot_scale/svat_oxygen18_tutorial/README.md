# Tutorial for SVAT-Oxygen18-model
SVAT indicates that only vertical processes are considered.

- `post_processing.py`: Produces figures and tables from data of the modelling experiment
- `input`: Contains data for a single year
- `svat_oxygen18.py`: SVAT-model setup to simulate transport of oxygen18. Set your parameters and output variables at the top of
the file.
