# Tutorial for 1D-event-model
oneD indicates that vertical processes and lateral processes are active.

- `post_processing.py`: Produces figures and tables from data of the modelling experiment
- `input`: Contains data of single year
- `oneD_event.py`: 1D-event-model setup (i.e. single event and fixed time steps). Set your parameters and output variables at the top of the file.
