# Modelling experiments with synthetically generated parameters
oneD indicates that vertical processes and lateral processes are active.

- `post_processing.py`: Produces figures and tables from data of the modelling experiment
- `parameter_grid.csv`: Contains synthetically generated parameters
- `input`: Contains data of single year from two different meteorological stations
- `oneD_event.py`: 1D setup of event model (i.e. single event and fixed time step)
- `oneD_event_noprec.py`: 1D setup of event model (i.e. single event and fixed time step) without precipitation. Instead we set the initial saturation water level to investigate the recession behaviour.
