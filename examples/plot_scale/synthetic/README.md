# Modelling experiments with synthetically generated parameters
oneD indicates that vertical processes and lateral processes are active.

- `post_processing.py`: Produces figures and tables from data of the modelling experiment
- `parameter_grid.csv`: Contains synthetically generated parameters
- `input`: Contains data of single year from two different meteorological stations
- `oneD.py`: 1D-Model setup
- `oneD_nosnow_noint.py`: 1D-Model setup with snow and interception turned off
- `oneD_nosnow_noint_noet.py`: 1D-Model setup with snow, interception and evapotranspiration turned off
- `oneD_lbc.py`: 1D-Model setup with lower boundary condition
