RoGeR, *Runoff Generation Research*, is a process-based hydrological model that can be applied from plot to catchment scale. RoGeR is written in pure Python, which facilitates model setup and model workflows. We want to enable high-performance hydrologic modelling with a clear focus on flexibility and usability.

RoGeR supports a NumPy backend for small-scale problems, and a
high-performance [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) backend
with CPU and GPU support. Parallel computation is available via MPI and supports
distributed execution on any number of nodes/CPU cores.

Roger provides

-   grid-based **1D models**
-   **offline solute transport** with several **StorAge selection (SAS) functions**
-   solute-specific biogeochemical processes
-   implementations of **capillary-driven infiltration (Green-Ampt)**
-   several **pre-implemented diagnostics** such as averages or collecting values
    at given time interval, variable time aggregation, travel time distributions
    and residence time distributions (written to netCDF4 output)
-   **pre-configured idealized and realistic setups** that are ready to
    run and easy to adapt
-   **accessibility and extensibility** due to high-level programming language Python


## Basic usage

To run Roger, you need to set up a model --- i.e., specify which settings
and model domain you want to use. This is done by subclassing the
`RogerSetup` base class in a *setup script* that is written in Python. A good
place to start is the
[SVAT Tutorial](https://github.com/Hydrology-IFH/roger/blob/master/roger/examples/plot_scale/svat_tutorial):


After setting up your model, all you need to do is call the model setup:
```bash
# move into the folder containing the model script
python svat.py
```

For more information on using Roger, have a look at [our
documentation](http://roger.readthedocs.io).

## Contributing

Contributions to Roger are always welcome, no matter if you spotted an
inaccuracy in [the documentation](https://roger.readthedocs.io), wrote a
new setup, fixed a bug, or even extended Roger\' core mechanics. There
are 2 ways to contribute:

1.  If you want to report a bug or request a missing feature, please
    [open an issue](https://github.com/Hydrology-IFH/roger/issues). If you
    are reporting a bug, make sure to include all relevant information
    for reproducing it (ideally through a *minimal* code sample).
2.  If you want to fix the issue yourself, or wrote an extension for
    Roger - great! You are welcome to submit your code for review by
    committing it to a repository and opening a [pull
    request](https://github.com/Hydrology-IFH/roger/pulls). However,
    before you do so, please check [the contribution
    guide](http://roger.readthedocs.io/quickstart/get-started.html#enhancing-Roger)
    for some tips on testing and benchmarking, and to make sure that
    your modifications adhere with our style policies. Most importantly,
    please ensure that you follow the [PEP8
    guidelines](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), use
    *meaningful* variable names, and document your code using
    [Google-style
    docstrings](http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html).

## TODO
- implement runoff and channel routing (e.g. kinematic wave or hydraulic approach)
- implement distributed model with run-on infiltration
- use coarser spatial and temporal resolution for computation of
groundwater-related processes
- implement baseflow in the groundwater routine. requires surface water depth.
- implement surface runoff generation for gravity-driven infiltration
- implement gravity-driven infiltration and percolation and include it into the transport routine
- implement time-variant sowing and harvesting of crops
