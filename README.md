## Description
`roger` is a hydrologic model written in Python.

## TODO
- implement distributed meteorological input (e.g. spatially distributed precipitation)
- implement runoff and channel routing (e.g. kinematic wave or hydraulic approach)
- implement RoGeR-Urban
- implement distributed model with run-on infiltration
- implement online-coupled solute transport
- use coarser spatial and temporal resolution for computation of
groundwater-related processes
- implement baseflow in the groundwater routine. requires surface water depth.
- add equations to docstrings
- write documentation for readthedocs (see `docs/`)
- write unit tests (see `tests/`) and prepare continous integration (see `.travis.yml`)
- use numba (or cython) to speed up computation time

## Installation and usage on Mac
Some instructions how to use the model from the repository. Please ensure that
Anaconda is installed (i.e. Python distribution). You can install it from
