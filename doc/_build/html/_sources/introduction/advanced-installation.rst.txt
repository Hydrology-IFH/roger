Advanced installation
=====================

Because Roger should be usable by both beginners and experts, it has a number of *optional* dependencies that are not strictly required to run Roger, but highly recommended in high-performance contexts.

.. note::

    Roger notifies you when a slower code path has to be taken due to a missing dependency. So unless you are getting a warning, there is usually no need to install optional dependencies (except JAX and MPI).

.. note::

    On this page, we give all installation instructions via ``pip install``. If you used conda to install Roger, consider replacing them with ``conda install``.

Using JAX
---------

Using the JAX backend, Roger is typically about 4x faster than with NumPy, so this should be the first thing to try if you want to get more performance.

JAX is available on all major platforms and can be installed via::

   $ pip install jax jaxlib

To use JAX on GPU, you have to install a CUDA-enabled version of jaxlib, e.g.::

   $ pip install jax jaxlib==0.1.67+cuda111 -f https://storage.googleapis.com/jax-releases/jax_releases.html

(see also `the JAX installation guide <https://github.com/google/jax#installation>`__).

Roger also supplies Cython extensions that optimize certain bottlenecks in JAX. You can make sure they are installed by running::

   $ pip install cython
   $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace

in the Roger repository root.

Using MPI
---------

To run Roger on more than one process you need to use MPI. This requires that you install an MPI implementation (such as OpenMPI) on your system. Additionally, you have to install ``mpi4py`` to interface with it::

   $ pip install mpi4py

Then, you can :ref:`run Roger in parallel via MPI <mpi-exec>`.

For optimal performance on many processes, Roger supports using PETSc as a linear solver. To use it, you will have to install the PETSc library and ``petsc4py`` Python package::

   $ PETSC_DIR=/path/to/petsc3.12 pip install petsc4py==3.12

Note that the versions of PETSc and ``petsc4py`` have to match.


Using JAX + MPI
---------------

To use JAX together with MPI, you need to install ``mpi4jax`` after installing ``mpi4py``::

   $ pip install mpi4jax
