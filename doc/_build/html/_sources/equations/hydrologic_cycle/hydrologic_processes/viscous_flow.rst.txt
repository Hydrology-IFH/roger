Viscous flow
=============

Volume flux density of the viscous flow :math:`q_{vf}` (:math:`m` :math:`s^{-1}`)


.. math::
  q_{vf}(F, L_c)=\frac{g}{3 \eta} L_c F^3


where :math:`F_{vf}` is the film thickness of the viscous flow (m), :math:`L_c` is the length of the
film contact (:math:`m^2 ` :math:`m^{-3}`), :math:`g` is the the acceleration of
gravity (:math:`m` :math:`s^{-s}`) and :math:`\eta` is the kinematic viscosity of water.

... work in progress ...
